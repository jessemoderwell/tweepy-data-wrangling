# tweepy-data-wrangling
The purpose of this project was to apply data wrangling and cleaning skills to the common problem of dirty and untidy data sources. The goal was to format the data in such a way that analysis is easy and naturally flows

The data of interest is from the twitter acount WeRateDogs, which posts photos of dogs and a nonsensical rating (11/10, 12/10). Udacity provided a table with predictions for each dog breed in the photo based on a neural network, and they also provided a table with extracted rating, dog name, and keyword

In python, I used matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations, and pandas and numpy for data wrangling and cleaning.
